Welcome to my Github Profile ðŸ˜„
===============================

Hi, I'm Yoann Fortin, freshly reconverted in web development after a career in the world of Logistics.

## Why this reconversion?

After multiple shoulder dislocations, and the operations that go with them, I had no choice but to change careers.   
>A bad thing for a good thing   
I discovered a world more in line with my way of being. 

## What I am doing now

After six months of training at the O'Clock school, I continued to learn about digital accessibility, but also about good code practices, advocated by the Software Craftsmanship.

In addition to watching various conferences and tutorials on the subject, I also read Clean Code by Robert C. Martin (nicknamed Uncle Bob), but also TDD by example by Kent BECK.   
Next books on my Roadmap,

*Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests by Steve Freeman Nat Pryce
*Design Patterns -- Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides (nicknamed the Gang of Four).

## My major projects

Apart from several small projects to perfect my knowledge, which did not need to last in time, I devoted myself to two larger projects.

ITer, of which I am the co-founder, is a platform aiming at gathering all the actors of the IT. The goal is to concentrate all the good resources on the IT universe, as well as its actors, and to allow juniors to find resources, mentors, and open-source projects to progress on.

Le P'tit Homme en Bleu is a personal blog to centralize all the resources that we have gathered during our research on Autism. The goal is to help other families like ours who may feel abandoned and helpless in the face of this "handicap".

## My favorite languages

In Front:

*HTML
*CSS | SCSS
*JavaScript | TypeScript
*ReactJS | Redux | And a first experience on VueJS


In Back:

*PHP
*NodeJS


Test Frameworks:
*Cypress
*Jest
